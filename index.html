                "Real Food" is a term that you see on many a recipe blog, so I'm not going to use it. I'll just say that I prefer to cook and eat (mostly) what nature gives us, not what's made in a factory.</p>

                <h3>Holiday Charcuterie Board</h3>
                <p>This holiday season may look a little different. Our gatherings may be smaller. But we can still make our celebrations special and this Holiday Charcuterie Board is a perfect way to do that. When our family gets together, charcuterie is always involved. </p>

                <h3>Thai Curry Chicken Soup</h3>
                <p>Thai Red Curry Chicken Soup is a hearty and satisfying soup with all of the delicious Thai flavours. It is, quite possibly, my favourite soup. And, I realized I've never made it for The Food Blog.</p>
